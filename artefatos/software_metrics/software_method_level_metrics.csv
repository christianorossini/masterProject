"Cyclomatic";"Cyclomatic Complexity";"McCabe Cyclomatic complexity as per the original NIST paper on the subject.
Edges – Nodes + Connected Components
McCabe also proved that the cyclomatic complexity of any structured program with only one entrance point and one exit point is equal to the number of decision points contained in that program plus one (refer to section V for the proof).
Understand counts the keywords for decision points (FOR, WHILE, etc) and then adds 1. For a switch statement, each ‘case’ is counted as 1. For languages with Macros the expanded Macro text is also included in the calculation.";"complexity";" McCabe Complexity (v(G))"

"Essential";"Essential Complexity";"Essential complexity is the Cyclomatic complexity after iteratively replacing all well structured control structures with a single statement. Structures such as if-then-else and while loops are considered well structured.
Understand calculate the essential complexity by removing all the structured subgraphs from the control graph and then calculating the complexity. A graph that has only the regular single entry/single exit loops or branches will be reducible to a graph with complexity one. Any branches into or out of a loop or decision will make the graph non-reducible and will have essentialcomplexity > 2. (You never get 2 since a graph with complexity 2 is always reducible to a graph with complexity 1).";"complexity";"ev(G)"
