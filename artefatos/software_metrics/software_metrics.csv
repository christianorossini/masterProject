CountClassCoupled,Coupling Between Objects,'The Coupling Between Object Classes (CBO) measure for a class is a count of the number of other classes to which it is coupled. Class A is coupled to class B if class A uses a type, data, or member from class B. This metric is also referred to as Efferent Coupling (Ce). Any number of couplings to a given class counts as 1 towards the metric total',object oriented,Chidamber & Kemerer - Coupling Between Objects (CBO)
CountClassDerived,Number of Children,Number of immediate subclasses. (i.e. the number of classes one level down the inheritance tree from this class).,object oriented,Chidamber & Kemerer - Number of Children (NOC)
CountDeclClassMethod,Class Methods,Number of class methods,object oriented,
CountDeclClassVariable,Class Variables,Number of class variables,object oriented,Lorenz & Kidd - Number of Variables (NV)

CountLine,Number of physical lines,Number of physical lines,volume,NL
CountLineBlank,Number of blank lines,Number of blank lines,volume,BLOC
CountLineCode,Source Lines of Code,The number of lines that contain source code. Note that a line can contain source and a comment and thus count towards multiple metrics. For Classes this is the sum of the CountLineCode for the member functions of the class,volume,'LOC, SLOC'
CountLineCodeDecl,Number of declarative Lines of Code,Number of lines containing declarative source code. Note that a line can be declarative and executable - int i =0; for instance.,volume,
CountLineCodeExe,Executable Lines of Code,Number of lines containing executable source code.,volume,
CountLineComment,Lines with Comments,'Number of lines containing comment. This can overlap with other code counting metrics. For instance int j = 1; // comment has a comment, is a source line, is an executable source line, and a declarative source line.',volume,CLOC
CountSemicolon,Number of semicolons,Number of semicolons,volume,
CountStmt,Statements,Number of declarative plus executable statements.,volume,
CountStmtDecl,Declarative Statements,Number of declarative statements,volume,

MaxEssential,Max Essential Complexity,Maximum essential complexity of all nested functions or methods.,complexity,
MaxInheritanceTree,Depth of Inheritance Tree (DIT),'The depth of a class within the inheritance hierarchy is the maximum number of nodes from the class node to the root of the inheritance tree. The root node has a DIT of 0. The deeper within the hierarchy, the more methods the class can inherit, increasing its complexity. ',complexity,Chidamber & Kemerer - Depth of Inheritance Tree (DIT)
MaxNesting,Nesting,'Maximum nesting level of control constructs (if, while, for, switch, etc.) in the function.',complexity,
PercentLackOfCohesion,Percent Lack of Cohesion in Methods,'100% minus average cohesion for class data members. Calculates what percentage of class methods use a given class instance variable. To calculate, average percentages for all of that class’es instance variables and subtract from 100%. A lower percentage means higher cohesion between class data and methods.',object oriented,Chidamber & Kemerer - Lack of Cohesion in Methods (LCOM/LOCM)
PercentLackOfCohesionModified,Percent Modified Lack of Cohesion in Methods,Same as PercentLackOfCohesion but does not penalize the use of accessor methods within a class to set/read variables.,object oriented,
